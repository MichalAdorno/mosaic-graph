# Mosaic Graph Generator

The program generates a mosaic graph. (This kind of graphs is commonly used in economics)
It takes a CSV file with the following format as an input:
```
textiles,25.0
clothing,25.0
footwear,50.0
```
and returns a graph as an output:

(Note: I skipped printing the category names on the graph because I was mainly interested in the algorithm to generate the graph.)
